I am launching a new free level-two intelligent textbook that teaches people how to track recent AI developments and integrate these developments into their overall organizational strategy.  At the heart of this course are some
fun MicroSims and graphic-novel stories that help people visualize the exponential growth in capabilities of AI systems.  You can add these MicroSims to any website with a single line of HTML.  I would love any feedback you have and suggestions on making the course more useful to this group.
