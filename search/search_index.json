Many routine and manual jobs are being automated, while new roles are emerging that demand different skill sets. In fact, the World Economic Forum projects that nearly 40% of core job skills will change by 2030, rendering a large share of today\u2019s skills obsolete. To thrive in this landscape, workers across all industries must develop new strengths \u2013 blending technical savvy with uniquely human capabilities. Below we explore the most important skills the general workforce will need in 2030, according to recent research and peer-reviewed studies.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/projecting-ai-skills/deep-research-ai-skills/#advanced-digital-and-ai-proficiency","title":"Advanced Digital and AI Proficiency","text":"<p>Digital literacy and AI fluency will be baseline requirements for most jobs. As AI and data-driven systems permeate every field, workers must be comfortable using, managing, or at least understanding these technologies. In-demand technical skills include competence in areas like machine learning, data analytics, Big Data, and cybersecurity. Even roles outside of tech will require the ability to interpret data and leverage AI tools in decision-making. For example, one study emphasizes that future industrial employees should know the basics of AI, programming, data processing, and big data management relevant to their domain. In essence, everyone will need to develop an \u201cAI literacy\u201d \u2013 understanding AI\u2019s capabilities and limitations, knowing how to apply AI solutions, and working alongside intelligent machines.</p> <p>Technical expertise will be especially crucial for those designing, implementing or overseeing AI systems. Roles such as AI specialists, software developers, data scientists, and process engineers will see surging demand. These professionals must master advanced competencies like natural language processing, machine vision, IoT integration, and robotics. A systematic review of AI in the workplace found that key technical skills for the future include not only programming and IT skills, but also the ability to develop AI/chatbot applications and to manage complex human\u2013robot collaboration systems. However, technical know-how alone is not enough \u2013 it needs to be paired with business acumen and ethical awareness. As automation integrates into business processes, employees who can combine data/AI skills with domain-specific knowledge (e.g. AI applications in healthcare, finance, law, manufacturing) will be highly valued.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/projecting-ai-skills/deep-research-ai-skills/#higher-cognitive-skills-creativity-and-critical-thinking","title":"Higher Cognitive Skills: Creativity and Critical Thinking","text":"<p>Ironically, as AI handles more routine cognitive work, higher-order thinking skills become even more important for humans. Studies consistently predict growing demand for skills like complex problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. AI excels at pattern recognition and optimization, but it struggles with novel situations and creative strategies. Human workers will be needed to define problems, interpret AI results, and innovate new solutions. The McKinsey Global Institute projects that by 2030, U.S. jobs will require much more time spent on creative, analytical, and critical thinking tasks (about a 19% increase from 2016) while basic data processing skills will decline sharply. In other words, the workforce must shift from routine execution to imagination, judgment, and design thinking \u2013 areas where human intuition and creativity outperform machines.</p> <p>Peer-reviewed research also highlights the value of cognitive flexibility and systems thinking \u2013 the ability to understand complex systems and approach problems from multiple angles. As workplaces grow more automated, employees will frequently face ambiguous problems that don\u2019t have clear algorithmic solutions. Critical thinking is needed to question AI outputs, address biases, and make ethical decisions when AI systems present recommendations. Likewise, innovative thinking will drive continuous improvement of AI-assisted processes. For example, a Frontiers study on higher education for 2030 emphasizes creative thinking as one of the four key skill pillars (along with data literacy, problem-solving, and programming) that future graduates must possess. Overall, human workers will add value through what researchers call \u201chigher cognitive skills\u201d \u2013 creativity, analytical reasoning, decision-making, and complex problem-solving \u2013 complementing the algorithmic efficiency of AI.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/projecting-ai-skills/deep-research-ai-skills/#social-and-emotional-intelligence","title":"Social and Emotional Intelligence","text":"<p>Across all industries, human-centric skills \u2013 those involving interpersonal interaction, empathy, and leadership \u2013 will remain indispensable in 2030. As automation expands, jobs increasingly emphasize the elements that only humans can do well: understanding emotions, building relationships, and providing a human touch. The World Economic Forum identifies collaboration, communication, empathy, and leadership as critical core skills that will \u201cremain critical\u201d despite technological advances. In health care, education, hospitality, and many service roles, emotional intelligence and caring cannot be automated. Even in tech-heavy fields, people who can effectively team up with others and with AI \u2013 e.g. communicating insights, managing diverse teams, and exercising ethical judgment \u2013 will have an edge.</p> <p>Research indicates a strong shift toward these soft skills. For instance, a systematic review found that essential future skills include creativity, communication, and emotional intelligence, noting a broad \u201cshift towards soft skills\u201d that must balance the technical skillset. Another study on automation and the future of work projects U.S. demand for social and emotional skills (like teamwork, negotiation, empathy) to rise \\~26% by 2030. These are skills that AI cannot easily replicate \u2013 an AI might crunch data or even generate text, but it lacks true emotional empathy or the ability to motivate and lead people. Leadership and people management capabilities will therefore grow in importance. Likewise, roles that involve high social interaction (e.g. coaching, customer service for complex issues, creative collaboration) will still heavily rely on human talent.</p> <p>Critically, communication skills will be needed not just in the traditional sense, but also for interacting through and with technology. Workers must articulate needs to AI systems (prompting, configuring tools) and explain AI-driven decisions to colleagues or clients in plain language. Those who can serve as effective bridges between the tech and human sides \u2013 sometimes called \u201cbilinguals\u201d who speak data/AI and business \u2013 will be in high demand. In sum, social intelligence \u2013 from clear communication to cultural awareness and teamwork \u2013 remains a cornerstone of the future workforce, ensuring that advancing technology actually translates into positive outcomes in human organizations.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/projecting-ai-skills/deep-research-ai-skills/#adaptability-and-lifelong-learning","title":"Adaptability and Lifelong Learning","text":"<p>Perhaps the most crucial meta-skill for 2030 is the ability to adapt and keep learning continuously. Given the rapid pace of change, specific technical skills may come and go, but those who can reskill and upskill quickly will thrive. The Future of Jobs Report 2025 warns that over half of all workers (59 out of 100) will require significant reskilling or upskilling by 2030, yet many might not get adequate training. In the U.S. and globally, employers already cite skill gaps as the top barrier to adopting new technologies. By one estimate, 39% of today\u2019s workforce skills will be outdated by 2030, making lifelong learning essential for job security.</p> <p>Therefore, adaptability, flexibility, and a growth mindset are highly prized traits. Peer-reviewed studies stress that a \u201ccommitment to lifelong learning\u201d is crucial for success in the AI era. Workers must be willing to continuously update their competencies as new tools, programming languages, or processes emerge. This could mean regularly taking online courses, earning micro-certifications, or learning on the job through experimentation. Importantly, adaptability also includes mental resilience \u2013 being able to cope with and embrace change rather than resist it. Employers value \u201clearning agility\u201d and positive attitudes, knowing that future roles will evolve quickly. In hiring, many companies are shifting to skill-based hiring \u2013 seeking candidates who demonstrate the right skills and the ability to learn, rather than specific degrees alone.</p> <p>Adaptability applies not just at the individual level but also in how people work with AI systems. As AI takes over more tasks, human workers must adapt their roles to focus on complementary activities (e.g. oversight, exception handling, strategy). This requires openness to change in job scope and comfort working in human-AI teams. A review in Administrative Sciences notes that combining technical skills with adaptability and ethical decision-making is key to leveraging AI effectively. Indeed, many companies plan to redeploy employees into new roles rather than lay them off, but that will only succeed if workers can quickly pick up new skills and transition roles. Continuous learning is also needed to maintain digital safety and ethics awareness, as technologies like AI evolve new risks.</p> <p>In summary, the year 2030\u2019s dynamic job landscape will favor those who are flexible, curious, and proactive about learning. As one study succinctly put it, preparing for the future of work means fostering \u201ca mindset that leads to innovation\u201d \u2013 one that embraces change and seeks new knowledge constantly. The general workforce will need to treat skill development as a career-long endeavor rather than a one-time education.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/projecting-ai-skills/deep-research-ai-skills/#conclusion-balancing-technical-and-human-skills","title":"Conclusion: Balancing Technical and Human Skills","text":"<p>If AI continues its exponential improvement, by 2030 it will handle an astonishing range of tasks \u2013 but human workers will remain vital by excelling at what machines cannot.

Draw the curve using p5.js and follow the guidelines for other infographics where when you hover over a region an infobox describes that region.  The history of AI is marked by cycles of extraordinary hype followed by periods of disillusionment when promised capabilities fail to materialize. Understanding past failures helps us assess whether we might be heading toward another \"AI winter\" in 2025.  <p>The user wants a p5.js infographic to showcase the Gartner technology hype-cycle. The infographic needs the classic curve: technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. They want interactive hover information on each region and to follow the guidelines in the \"standard-rules.md\", including a responsive layout and hover functions. I'll write up the entire p5.js sketch code with the necessary functions\u2014like setup(), draw(), and windowResized(). It needs to be fully operational in p5.js editor.</p> <p>I\u2019ll follow the structure of previous MicroSims like ai-causes.js and book-gen-workflow.js, focusing on the drawing area and an interactive hover feature without controls. I'll define regions with labels and descriptions for each part of the hype-cycle curve. To detect hover, I'll check if the mouse is within the defined X-range of each phase. By dividing the X-axis into 5 segments and using simple checks, the region description will appear when hovering. I'll draw the hype-cycle curve with vertices or bezier points for smooth transitions between phases.</p> <p>For the hype-cycle curve, I'll set positions for key points like the peak, trough, slope, and plateau, adjusting them relative to the canvas. I'll use the curveVertex method to smoothly connect these points, drawing a cubic Bezier for each segment. Each region will be defined by the X-range of the curve, and when the mouse hovers over a segment, the corresponding description will appear. The description area will be placed within the control area, and a semi-transparent rectangle will highlight the hovered region. I'll use checkHover to determine which region is being hovered over.</p>"},{"location":"sims/idea-funnel/","title":"Generative AI Center of Excellence Idea Funnel","text":"<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=\"https://dmccreary.github.io/tracking-ai-course/sims/idea-funnel/main.html\"  height=\"660px\" scrolling=\"no\"\n  style=\"overflow: hidden;\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Run the Generative AI Center of Excellence Idea Funnel Infographic</p> <p>Edit Generative AI Center of Excellence Idea Funnel Infographic</p>"},{"location":"sims/idea-funnel/#how-to-use-this-infographic","title":"How to Use This Infographic","text":"<p>I've created a comprehensive interactive infographic for the GenAI Center of Excellence idea funnel process.

While Lenat and his team at Cycorp painstakingly encoded millions of logical rules teaching Cyc facts like \"water is wet,\" the AI field was revolutionized by deep learning neural networks in the 2010s, which achieved superior performance in language understanding, image recognition, and reasoning without any hand-coded rules\u2014accomplishing in a few years what Cyc couldn't achieve in decades. Until his death in August 2023, Lenat remained convinced that true AI required symbolic reasoning and explainability, arguing that neural networks were merely sophisticated pattern matchers, not genuine intelligence.

Show LeCun as an elder statesman of AI, but still actively working and mentoring young researchers. The scene should be set in a futuristic lab where his influence is visible everywhere \u2013 from CNNs processing visual data to young scientists working on world models and next-generation AI. The atmosphere should be optimistic and inclusive, showing a diverse group of researchers continuing his legacy of challenging assumptions and pushing boundaries.  <p>Today, Yann LeCun continues his quest for truly intelligent machines. His journey from a curious teenager in Paris to a pioneering force in artificial intelligence shows that the greatest obstacles to progress are often our own preconceptions. By combining deep technical understanding with visionary leadership, he didn't just overcome challenges \u2013 he redefined what was possible.</p> <p>As he likes to say, \"The best way to predict the future is to create it.\" And for Yann LeCun, the future of artificial intelligence is still being written.</p> <p></p> Show Image Prompt Image 11:  Please generate a new drawing.  It is a wide-landscape drawing that might appear in a graphic novel.  A symbolic closing panel showing hands passing a torch between generations of AI researchers. In the background, the evolution of neural networks can be seen as a spiral timeline, from simple perceptrons to modern CNNs to future world models. The torch itself should be rendered as a glowing neural network, symbolizing the continuous flow of knowledge and innovation. The style should be hopeful and inspiring, suggesting that the story continues with each new generation of researchers."},{"location":"stories/yann-lecun/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Here are the references reformatted:</p> <ol> <li>Yann LeCun Personal Website</li> <li>Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition - 1998 - Proceedings of the IEEE - LeCun's seminal CNN paper describing implementation at AT&amp;T Bell Labs</li> <li>MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits - 2010 (Updated) - Online Database - Original dataset created from Bell Labs work on postal code recognition</li> <li>Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network - 1990 - Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems - Early AT&amp;T Bell Labs application work</li> <li>ACM Turing Award Winners - 2019 - ACM Official Page - Official announcement of 2018 Turing Award to LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton</li> <li>NYU Center for Data Science Launch - 2012 - NYU Official Page - Founding of center with LeCun as inaugural director</li> <li>ICLR Conference History - 2013 - ICLR Official Website - Co-founded by LeCun and Bengio as premier ML conference</li> <li>LeCun's NYU Profile - Current - NYU CS Department - Official position at NYU and CV</li> <li>LeCun on AI and World Models - 2022 - MIT Technology Review - Recent interview on LLM limitations and AGI</li> <li>Facebook AI Research Appointment - 2013 - Meta Research Blog - Announcement of LeCun as FAIR director at Meta</li> <li>LeCun at Bell Labs Research - 1988-2003 - Bell Labs Archives - Documentation of LeCun's tenure and achievements at AT&amp;T Bell Labs</li> </ol>"}]}
