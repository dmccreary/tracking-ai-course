# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a three-day educational course called "Tracking AI Course" that analyzes the exponential growth of AI systems capabilities and their strategic implications for organizations. It's implemented as a static documentation website using MkDocs with interactive simulations.

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Install MkDocs and dependencies
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material

# Serve the site locally for development
mkdocs serve

# Build the static site
mkdocs build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

### Plugin Development
```bash
# Install the custom social_override plugin
pip install -e .
```

## Architecture Overview

### Site Structure
- **docs/**: All course content and documentation
  - **chapters/**: Individual course chapters organized by topic
  - **sims/**: Interactive MicroSimulations with JavaScript visualizations
  - **stories/**: Case studies and historical narratives about AI development
  - **prompts/**: AI prompt engineering examples and exercises
  - **img/**: Static images and graphics
  - **css/**: Custom styling
  - **js/**: Custom JavaScript

- **plugins/**: Custom MkDocs plugins
  - **social_override.py**: Plugin for customizing social media preview images

- **data/**: Course datasets (CSV files with AI model data)
- **slides/**: Presentation materials
- **src/**: Source utilities (CSV to JSON conversion tools)
- **site/**: Generated static website (auto-generated by MkDocs)

### Key Technologies
- **MkDocs**: Static site generator with Material theme
- **Python**: For custom plugins and data processing
- **JavaScript**: For interactive simulations and visualizations
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting and deployment

### Content Organization
The course content follows a structured educational approach:
1. **Chapters**: Core educational content covering AI growth patterns, benchmarks, and strategic implications
2. **MicroSims**: Interactive visualizations demonstrating concepts like exponential growth, technology adoption curves, and strategic frameworks
3. **Stories**: Historical narratives about key moments in AI development
4. **Prompts**: Examples of effective AI prompt engineering

### Custom Features
- **Social Override Plugin**: Allows pages to specify custom social media preview images via frontmatter metadata
- **Interactive Simulations**: JavaScript-based visualizations that demonstrate AI concepts
- **Comprehensive Navigation**: Hierarchical organization supporting educational progression
- **Material Design**: Professional appearance suitable for educational and business contexts

## Content Management

### Adding New Chapters
1. Create markdown file in `docs/chapters/`
2. Add to navigation in `mkdocs.yml`
3. Follow existing chapter structure and style

### Adding New Simulations
1. Create directory in `docs/sims/`
2. Include `index.md`, `main.html`, and JavaScript files
3. Add to MicroSims navigation section

### Working with Data
- CSV data files are stored in `data/` directory
- Use `src/csv-to-json/` utilities for data conversion
- Simulations often consume JSON data for visualizations

## Site Configuration

The site uses MkDocs Material theme with:
- Social media plugin for preview images
- LaTeX equation support via MathJax
- Code highlighting and copy functionality
- Google Analytics integration
- Navigation features (expansion, breadcrumbs, search)
