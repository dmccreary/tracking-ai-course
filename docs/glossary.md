#### Zero-Shot Learning
The capability of artificial intelligence systems to accurately perform tasks or make predictions for categories or scenarios not encountered during training, based solely on descriptive information.

**Example:** Modern LLMs demonstrate impressive zero-shot learning capabilities, allowing them to follow new instructions or answer questions about concepts they weren't explicitly trained to handle.
