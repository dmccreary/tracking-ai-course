# Skepticism of the LLM Only Path

On March 4th, 2025 Nature published an article by Nicola Jones that surveyed AI researchers
on our progress toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  Here is a summary
of some points this article says about the limitations of current LLMs.

## Summary of LLM Limitations According to the Nature Article

The Nature article by Nicola Jones, published on March 4, 2025, reports on a survey conducted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) among AI researchers. Here are the key findings about the limitations of current LLMs:

### Fundamental Architectural Limitations

The survey reveals that most respondents are skeptical that the technology underpinning large-language models is sufficient for artificial general intelligence. Specifically:

84% of AI professionals believe that relying solely on neural networks is insufficient for achieving AGI. The researchers don't believe that simply scaling up neural networks will bridge the gap to human-level intelligence.

### Scaling is Not the Solution

Over 75% believe that merely scaling up existing AI systems won't suffice. The survey reveals that the vast majority of AI researchers doubt that continuing to make neural networks bigger and training them on more data - the approach that has driven recent AI advances - will lead to AGI.

an overwhelming 76 percent of respondents said it was "unlikely" or "very unlikely" to succeed when asked about whether scaling up current AI approaches could lead to achieving AGI.

### Need for Hybrid Approaches

a majority advocate for incorporating symbolic AI techniques and more than 60% of those surveyed support the idea that human-level reasoning requires a blend of neural network-based systems and symbolic AI.

### Specific Architectural Limitations

The article, as reported by various sources, indicates that current LLMs lack:
- True understanding of concepts (they recognize statistical patterns but don't grasp meaning)
- Inherent logical reasoning capabilities
- Consistent and reliable decision-making abilities
- The ability to structure explicit logic and reasoning

### Priority Shift

Interestingly, 75% prioritize developing AI with a favorable risk-benefit profile over pursuing AGI, suggesting a shift in research priorities from pure pursuit of AGI to more practical and beneficial AI development.

The article paints a picture of the AI research community questioning the fundamental approach that has dominated recent AI development and calling for a fundamental shift in methodology to achieve true artificial general intelligence.


The Nature article titled *“How AI can achieve human-level intelligence: researchers call for change in tack”* by Nicola Jones, published on March 4, 2025, highlights several limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

### Key Limitations of Current LLMs

1. **Lack of True Reasoning and Planning**: LLMs excel at generating human-like text but struggle with tasks requiring genuine reasoning and long-term planning. Their outputs are often based on pattern recognition rather than understanding, limiting their ability to perform complex cognitive tasks.

2. **Absence of Common Sense and World Modeling**: These models lack an inherent understanding of the physical world and common sense reasoning. Without the ability to model real-world scenarios, their applicability in dynamic and unpredictable environments is constrained.

3. **Inadequate Internal Deliberation**: Unlike humans, LLMs do not possess internal deliberative processes. This deficiency hampers their capacity to evaluate information critically and make informed decisions, which are essential components of human-like intelligence.

4. **Overreliance on Data Scaling**: The current trajectory of enhancing LLMs primarily involves increasing data and computational resources. However, this approach yields diminishing returns concerning the development of AGI, as it doesn't address foundational cognitive limitations.

### Calls for a Paradigm Shift

The article emphasizes that to progress toward AGI, researchers advocate for a shift from merely scaling existing models to developing new architectures that incorporate elements like symbolic reasoning, embodied cognition, and neural-symbolic integration. Such approaches aim to imbue AI systems with a more profound understanding and flexible problem-solving abilities akin to human intelligence.

This perspective aligns with views from AI experts like Yann LeCun, who argue that LLMs, in their current form, are insufficient for achieving human-level intelligence and that alternative methodologies are necessary for meaningful advancement in the field. ([Financial Times][1])

In summary, while LLMs have made significant strides in natural language processing, their inherent limitations necessitate a reevaluation of strategies to achieve true artificial general intelligence.
