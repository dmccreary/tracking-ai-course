# AGI Predicted Dates

!!! prompt
    I am interested in when experts think that we will reach a level of AI called "Artificial General Intelligence" or AGI.  Although I understand that the term is not precisely defined, it is a widely used benchmark date.  Please gather everything you know about what date experts in AI will predict we will  archive this level of intelligence.  Summarize your results in a three column table with the following format:

    Column 1:  Name of person or organization
    Column 2: Expected year/month
    Column 3: Note on credibility of the person or organization

Here is a summary of predictions regarding the expected arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), compiled from various experts and organizations:
