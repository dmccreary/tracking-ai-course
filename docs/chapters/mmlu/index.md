# The MMLU

The **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)** benchmark is currently the **most referenced** and **most reputable** benchmark for evaluating the general intelligence of large language models (LLMs), regardless of size.

## About the MMLU

The MMLU rating consists of 16,000 multiple-choice questions across 57 academic subjects.  Questions are given to a LLM in the form of text.  The LLM must return the correct answer to get a point.

Note that most human's do not get a perfect score.  The average person only gets a score of 89.6% correct.

Because the MMLU is so popular, many people feel that some LLM builders pre-train their models on MMLU questions.  This will skew the results and make some models appear more capable than they really are.

### ✅ **Why MMLU is the Most Trusted Benchmark**

| Feature                      | Explanation                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comprehensive Coverage**   | Tests models across **57 subjects** spanning STEM, humanities, law, and more.                                        |
| **Multistep Reasoning**      | Focuses on tasks requiring **knowledge recall, reasoning, and comprehension**, not just surface-level text matching. |
| **Human Comparison**         | Allows comparison to **average human performance** (e.g., college graduate benchmarks).                              |
| **Adopted by Major Players** | Used in the evaluation of GPT-4 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google DeepMind), Claude (Anthropic), LLaMA (Meta), and others.    |
| **Backed by Academics**      | Developed by AI alignment researchers including Dan Hendrycks at UC Berkeley.                                        |
| **Stable & Reproducible**    | Public, well-documented, and widely supported in academic and commercial research.                                   |

| Name                     | Focus Area                              | Notes                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HELLASWAG**            | Commonsense inference                   | Good for measuring plausibility reasoning but less broad than MMLU.                 |
| **ARC-Challenge**        | Grade-school level science questions    | Focuses on reasoning, useful but narrower scope.                                    |
| **Big-Bench Hard (BBH)** | Multitask difficult questions           | Curated by Google; strong but newer and less universal than MMLU.                   |
| **HumanEval / MBPP**     | Code generation                         | Specialized in programming, not general reasoning.                                  |
| **TruthfulQA**           | Truthfulness & factual consistency      | Measures how likely a model is to hallucinate; not comprehensive in scope.          |
| **Elo Ratings (Arena)**  | Battle-tested via model-vs-model voting | Popular in community evals (e.g., LMSYS), but less academic and not skill-targeted. |
