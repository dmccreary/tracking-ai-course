# Generative AI Center of Excellence

!!! prompt
    Create a new document describing the process for an generative AI center of excellence (GenAI CoE).  The core of this process is to create a "funnel" of generative AI ideas.   

    A one hour online training program is offered to help people generate grate ideas that are both practical and have a good ROI.

    Everyone in the organization can submit their ideas in a web form.

    The ideas are reviewed by a GenAI expert group and a review is sent to the submitters and their managers.

    Ideas are categorized and scored based on factors such as feasibility, risk and benefits.

    Awards are given out to individuals or teams with the best ideas.

    Each month the expert group team reviews new ideas and selects a few to be funded by a development team.

    The GenAI development teams report to the GenAI CoE on their progress.

    Each quarter, the GenAI CoE reports to executives on the status of their idea funnel.  The funnel reports are similar to a traditional "pipeline" report that shows how many ideas are in various stages.

    The GenAI team has a taxonomy of the types of problems solved and a taxonomy of the ways they are solved (tools and frameworks).

    The GenAI team encourages teams to work together that have similar problems and to build a shared code repository for the entire organization to use.
