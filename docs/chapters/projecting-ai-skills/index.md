# Projecting AI Skills

If we look at the [data](../../sims/ai-doubling-rate/index.md) we can make the assumption that
AI capabilities are doubling every seven months.  This prompt will help use extrapolate the skills that will be relevent in 2030.

## Doubling Assumpiton Prompt

!!! prompt
    Let's assume that AI capabilities are growing at an exponential rate.  Today, a typical LLM will get a one-hour task correct 50%  of the time.  The time of task that an LLM will get correct 50% of the time is doubling every seven months.  If we assume that July 2025 is one hour, give the doubling task times for the next five years.  Fill in this list for the next five years:

    July 2025 - 1 hour
    February 2026 - 2 hours
    September 2026 - 4 hours

## Response

### Thought process

Claude Sonnet 4 took 13s to do this analysis

The user is asking me to project the exponential growth of AI capabilities based on a specific doubling pattern. They've established:

- Starting point: July 2025 = 1 hour
- Doubling period: Every 7 months
- Pattern shown: July 2025 (1 hour) → February 2026 (2 hours) → September 2026 (4 hours)

Let me verify the pattern first:

- July 2025 to February 2026 = 7 months (1 hour → 2 hours)
- February 2026 to September 2026 = 7 months (2 hours → 4 hours)

So the pattern is correct. Now I need to continue this for the next five years from July 2025, which would take us to July 2030.

Let me calculate each 7-month interval:

- Starting: July 2025 = 1 hour

- July 2025 + 7 months = February 2026 = 2 hours
- February 2026 + 7 months = September 2026 = 4 hours
- September 2026 + 7 months = April 2027 = 8 hours
- April 2027 + 7 months = November 2027 = 16 hours
- November 2027 + 7 months = June 2028 = 32 hours
- June 2028 + 7 months = January 2029 = 64 hours
- January 2029 + 7 months = August 2029 = 128 hours
- August 2029 + 7 months = March 2030 = 256 hours
- March 2030 + 7 months = October 2030 = 512 hours

Let me double-check the month calculations:

- July + 7 = February (next year)
- February + 7 = September
- September + 7 = April (next year)
- April + 7 = November
- November + 7 = June (next year)
- June + 7 = January (next year)
- January + 7 = August
- August + 7 = March (next year)
- March + 7 = October

I've confirmed the month progression matches the exponential growth calculation. The timeline extends slightly beyond the initial 5-year projection, reaching October 2030, which is 5 years and 3 months from the starting point. The hours grow from 1 to 512, demonstrating a consistent doubling pattern every 7 months.
Converting the hour values reveals a clear progression of time:

- 32 hours translates to 1.3 days
- 64 hours becomes 2.7 days
- 128 hours expands to 5.3 days
- 256 hours reaches 10.7 days
- 512 hours extends to 21.3 days

I'll organize these conversions to enhance readability, showing how quickly the time accumulates through exponential growth.

### Actual Response

Based on the exponential growth pattern you've established (doubling every 7 months), here's the projected timeline for AI task capability:

**AI Task Capability Growth (50% Success Rate Threshold)**

- **July 2025** - 1 hour
- **February 2026** - 2 hours  
- **September 2026** - 4 hours
- **April 2027** - 8 hours
- **November 2027** - 16 hours
- **June 2028** - 32 hours (1.3 days)
- **January 2029** - 64 hours (2.7 days)
- **August 2029** - 128 hours (5.3 days)
- **March 2030** - 256 hours (10.7 days)
- **October 2030** - 512 hours (21.3 days)

## Key Observations

1. **Crossing the "day barrier"**: By June 2028, AI systems would be capable of handling tasks that take over a full day with 50% reliability.

2. **Weekly tasks by 2029**: By August 2029, we're approaching the ability to handle week-long tasks.

3. **Monthly projects by 2030**: By March 2030, AI could potentially handle projects spanning 2-3 weeks.

This exponential progression illustrates the dramatic acceleration in AI capabilities that could occur if current growth trends continue. The implications for knowledge work, project management, and organizational productivity become increasingly profound as we move from hour-long tasks to multi-week projects that AI can complete autonomously with reasonable reliability.

## Step 2: Skill Assessments

!!! Prompt
    Now assume it is 2030.  What types of new skills will be needed by humans to complement the power of these new AI models?

Thought process5sThe user is asking me to project forward to 2030, where according to the exponential growth pattern we just calculated, AI systems would be capable of handling tasks that take 2-3 weeks (512+ hours) with 50% reliability. This represents a massive shift in AI capabilities.
I need to think about what this means practically:

- AI can handle complex, multi-week projects
- AI can likely handle most routine knowledge work
- AI probably has much better reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities
- AI might be able to handle complex research, analysis, writing, coding projects

Given this context, what skills would humans need? I should think about:

- Skills that remain uniquely human
- Skills needed to work effectively with such powerful AI
- New types of problems that emerge when AI handles most routine work
- Skills needed to manage and direct AI systems
- Skills related to human relationships, creativity, ethics, judgment

I should frame this in the context of the course materials provided, which focus on AI's impact on knowledge organizations, education, and business strategy.

### The Meta-Skill: Human-AI Collaboration

Perhaps most importantly, humans in 2030 will need to master the **art of collaboration with artificial intelligence**—knowing when to lead, when to follow, when to intervene, and when to step back. This requires a deep understanding of both AI capabilities and human nature, combined with the wisdom to orchestrate both for maximum positive impact.

The humans who thrive in 2030 won't be those who can do what AI does, but those who can do what AI cannot: provide meaning, purpose, ethical guidance, and the irreplaceable human touch that transforms technological capability into genuine value for people and society.
