    I would like you to generate a new p5.js MicroSim sketch that displays a timeline view of the key AI benchmarks and when they were introduced.  Please use the format of the file ai-pace-accelerating.js in the Project knowledge area.  Begin with early benchmarks on simple question answering and finish with the most recent benchmarks that focus on specialized topics like coding skills, math skills, medical diagnosis and answering legal questions to pass a bar exam.
