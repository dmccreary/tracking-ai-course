This MicroSim extends the analysis from [METR.org's research](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) by projecting AI capabilities forward to 2030 based on the observed exponential growth pattern.

## Overview

This MicroSim visualizes **how AI task completion capabilities are projected to evolve over time**, showing:

- **Historical data** from 2019-2025 showing actual AI model performance
- **Time on the horizontal axis** (year) for easy temporal understanding
- **Task completion horizons on the vertical axis** (in minutes/hours/days)
- **Exponential trend line** projecting capabilities to 2030 based on 7-month doubling time

The visualization demonstrates that AI's ability to complete longer tasks is growing exponentially, with capabilities roughly doubling every 7 months according to METR's research.

## Key Insights

### Exponential Growth Pattern
The data reveals a clear exponential trend with a **doubling time of approximately 7 months**. This means:
- Every 7 months, AI models can reliably complete tasks twice as long
- By 2030, if this trend continues, models could work on tasks lasting days or weeks
- This growth rate is faster than many other technology trends

### What the Projection Means
If the 7-month doubling time continues:
- **2026**: Models could reliably work on tasks lasting 10-20+ hours
- **2028**: Tasks lasting multiple days become feasible
- **2030**: Week-long autonomous task completion may be possible

**Important caveat**: Exponential trends don't continue forever. Physical limits, diminishing returns, or fundamental barriers could slow this growth.

## Interactive Features

## Understanding the Projection

### The 7-Month Doubling Time
Based on METR's analysis, AI task completion capabilities have been doubling approximately every 7 months. This is calculated from:
- Historical model performance from 2019-2025
- Consistent pattern across different model families
- Both 50% and 80% success probability metrics

### How the Trend Line Works
The projection uses an exponential formula:
```
Future Capability = Current Capability × 2^(months_elapsed / 7)
```

For example, starting from GPT-5's 8,239 minutes (137 hours) at 50% success:
- **7 months later (March 2026)**: ~16,500 minutes (275 hours / 11.5 days)
- **14 months later (October 2026)**: ~33,000 minutes (550 hours / 23 days)
- **By 2030**: Potentially 100,000+ minutes (1,700+ hours / 70+ days)

### Limitations and Caveats

**This is a projection, not a prediction.** Several factors could slow or stop this trend:

1. **Fundamental limits**: Tasks requiring real-world feedback may hit physical time constraints
2. **Diminishing returns**: As tasks get longer, new bottlenecks may emerge
3. **Measurement challenges**: Defining and measuring very long tasks becomes harder
4. **Economic factors**: The cost of running models for days/weeks may be prohibitive
5. **Reliability requirements**: Longer tasks may require entirely new approaches to ensure robustness

## Customization Guide

### Modifying the Data

To update with new models, edit the `modelData` object in `script.js`:

```javascript
const modelData = {
    frontier: [
        {
            name: 'Model Name',
            horizon50: 100.0,  // 50% success time in minutes
            horizon80: 20.0,   // 80% success time in minutes
            date: '2025-MM-DD' // Release date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
        }
    ]
};
```

### Adjusting the Trend Line

To change the doubling time assumption, modify `doublingTimeMonths` in `script.js`:

```javascript
const doublingTimeMonths = 7;  // Change this value
```

### Extending the Time Range

To project beyond 2030, update the `endDate` in the `calculateTrendLine()` function:

```javascript
const endDate = new Date('2035-12-31');  // Extend to 2035
```

And update the X-axis maximum:

```javascript
max: new Date('2035-12-31').getTime()
```
