## How to Use

- Hover over each level to see detailed descriptions of the characteristics and capabilities at that maturity stage
- The steps ascend from Level 1 (Ad Hoc) on the bottom to Level 5 (Transformative) at the top
- Each level is color-coded and shows the progression from reactive to proactive AI adoption

The Five Levels:

- Level 1 - Ad Hoc (Red): Scattered, experimental AI efforts with no formal strategy
- Level 2 - Experimental (Orange): Small-scale pilots and growing AI awareness
- Level 3 - Systematic (Yellow): Coordinated AI initiatives with governance frameworks
- Level 4 - Strategic (Teal): AI integrated into core business strategy and operations
- Level 5 - Transformative (Blue): AI fundamental to organizational identity and competitive advantage

This model helps organizations assess their current AI maturity and understand what capabilities they need to develop to advance to the next level. It's particularly useful for strategic planning and identifying gaps in AI readiness.

## Use by AI Strategy Task Force

# Lesson Plan: Using the AI Capability Maturity Model for Strategic Planning

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, committee members will be able to:

- Assess their organization's current AI maturity level using the CMM framework
- Identify specific gaps and opportunities for advancement
- Develop actionable strategies to progress to the next maturity level
- Create alignment among stakeholders on AI strategic priorities
- Establish measurable goals and success metrics for AI initiatives

## Target Audience

AI strategy committee members, including executives, department heads, IT leaders, and key stakeholders involved in organizational AI planning and implementation.

## Materials Needed

- AI Capability Maturity Model interactive visualization
- Printed assessment worksheets
- Flipchart paper and markers
- Sticky notes
- Current organizational AI inventory (if available)

## Session Structure

### Opening: Framework Introduction

**Activity: Interactive Exploration**

- Have each committee member individually explore the AI CMM visualization
- Ask participants to hover over each level and read the descriptions carefully
- Encourage note-taking on characteristics that resonate with their current organizational situation

**Discussion: Understanding the Framework**

- Facilitate group discussion on the five maturity levels
- Clarify any questions about the definitions and characteristics
- Emphasize that this is a developmental model, not a judgment tool

### Core Activity 1: Current State Assessment

**Individual Assessment**

- Provide each participant with an assessment worksheet based on the CMM levels
- Have them independently evaluate where they believe the organization currently sits
- Encourage honest assessment across different organizational areas (data, governance, talent, infrastructure, culture)

**Small Group Calibration**

- Divide into small groups of 3-4 people
- Have groups compare individual assessments and discuss differences
- Ask groups to reach consensus on the organization's current maturity level
- Identify specific evidence supporting their assessment

**Large Group Synthesis**

- Each small group presents their assessment and rationale
- Facilitate discussion to build organizational consensus
- Document areas of agreement and disagreement
- Capture specific examples and evidence for the agreed-upon current state

### Core Activity 2: Gap Analysis and Target Setting

**Vision Setting**

- Have the committee discuss and agree on their target maturity level within a specific timeframe
- Consider organizational goals, resources, and external factors
- Document the rationale for the chosen target level

**Gap Identification**

- Using the CMM descriptions, identify specific gaps between current and target states
- Organize gaps by category (technology, people, processes, governance, culture)
- Prioritize gaps based on impact and feasibility

**Barrier Analysis**

- Brainstorm potential obstacles to advancing maturity levels
- Categorize barriers as technical, organizational, cultural, or resource-related
- Discuss strategies for overcoming each type of barrier

### Core Activity 3: Strategic Planning

**Initiative Development**

- Based on gap analysis, develop specific initiatives to advance maturity
- Ensure initiatives address the most critical gaps identified
- Consider dependencies between different initiatives

**Resource Planning**

- Discuss resource requirements for each initiative (budget, personnel, technology)
- Identify potential sources of funding and support
- Consider timeline and sequencing of initiatives

**Success Metrics**

- Define specific, measurable indicators of progress for each maturity level
- Establish baseline measurements where possible
- Create a monitoring and evaluation framework

### Synthesis and Next Steps

**Action Planning**

- Assign ownership for each major initiative
- Establish immediate next steps and accountability measures
- Schedule follow-up meetings and checkpoints

**Communication Strategy**

- Develop key messages about the AI maturity assessment for different stakeholder groups
- Plan how to communicate the strategic direction to the broader organization
- Consider change management implications

**Documentation**

- Capture all decisions, assessments, and plans in a formal document
- Create a visual summary of current state, target state, and key initiatives
- Establish a process for regular reassessment using the CMM framework

## Assessment and Evaluation

**Immediate Assessment**

- Committee members complete a brief reflection on their understanding of the organization's AI maturity
- Collect feedback on the usefulness of the CMM framework for strategic planning

**Follow-up Evaluation**

- Schedule quarterly reviews using the CMM to track progress
- Adjust strategies based on advancement through maturity levels
- Document lessons learned and best practices

## Key Facilitation Notes

**For the Facilitator:**

- Encourage honest, data-driven assessment rather than aspirational thinking
- Help participants distinguish between current capabilities and future plans
- Focus on specific evidence and examples rather than general impressions
- Maintain a developmental rather than evaluative tone throughout
- Be prepared to manage disagreements about current state assessment
- Keep discussions focused on actionable outcomes

**Common Challenges:**

- Organizations may overestimate their current maturity level
- Different departments may be at different maturity levels
- Some participants may focus on technology while others emphasize culture
- Resource constraints may limit ambitious advancement plans

## Extension Activities

**Department-Level Assessment**

- Have individual departments complete their own CMM assessment
- Compare departmental maturity levels to identify organizational inconsistencies
- Develop department-specific advancement plans

**Competitive Analysis**

- Research and assess competitors' apparent AI maturity levels
- Use insights to inform strategic positioning and timing decisions

**Stakeholder Engagement**

- Present CMM assessment to executive leadership and board members
- Gather input from front-line employees on AI readiness and concerns
- Engage with external AI experts for validation and benchmarking

## Expected Outcomes

By the conclusion of this session, the committee should have:

- A clear, consensus-based assessment of organizational AI maturity
- Identified specific gaps and advancement opportunities
- Developed a roadmap for progressing to the next maturity level
- Established accountability and next steps for implementation
- Created a framework for ongoing strategic monitoring and adjustment

This lesson plan transforms the AI Capability Maturity Model from an informational tool into a practical framework for strategic decision-making and organizational development.
