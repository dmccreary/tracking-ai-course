## How to Use

- Hover over each level to see detailed descriptions of the characteristics and capabilities at that maturity stage
- The steps ascend from Level 1 (Ad Hoc) on the bottom to Level 5 (Transformative) at the top
- Each level is color-coded and shows the progression from reactive to proactive AI adoption

The Five Levels:

- Level 1 - Ad Hoc (Red): Scattered, experimental AI efforts with no formal strategy
- Level 2 - Experimental (Orange): Small-scale pilots and growing AI awareness
- Level 3 - Systematic (Yellow): Coordinated AI initiatives with governance frameworks
- Level 4 - Strategic (Teal): AI integrated into core business strategy and operations
- Level 5 - Transformative (Blue): AI fundamental to organizational identity and competitive advantage

## AI Stage Terminology

- Stage 1: Manual processes, no AI
- Stage 2: Basic automation, simple ML
- Stage 3: Advanced AI applications
- Stage 4: AI-first organization
- Stage 5: AI-native, fully integrated

This model helps organizations assess their current AI maturity and understand what capabilities they need to develop to advance to the next level. It's particularly useful for strategic planning and identifying gaps in AI readiness.
