## Lesson Structure

### Opening Activity: Current State Assessment

**Individual Reflection Exercise**

Participants complete a rapid organizational assessment:

1. **Technology Decision Patterns**: Review the last 5 major technology adoptions in your organization

   - When did you adopt relative to market introduction?
   - What drove the timing decisions?
   - What were the outcomes?

2. **Risk Tolerance Indicators**:

   - Budget allocation for experimental vs. proven technologies
   - Decision-making processes for new technology investments
   - Tolerance for implementation failures or setbacks

3. **Competitive Positioning**:

   - How does your organization typically position itself relative to competitors in technology adoption?
   - Are you usually first, fast follower, or wait-and-see?

### Core Content: Understanding Strategic Positioning

#### The Five Adoption Categories: Strategic Implications

**Innovators (2.5%): The Technology Pioneers**

*Strategic Characteristics:*

- Willing to invest in unproven technologies for potential first-mover advantages
- Accept high failure rates in exchange for breakthrough possibilities
- Often have dedicated R&D budgets for experimental initiatives
- Can influence industry standards and vendor development

*AI Strategy Implications:*

- Early access to cutting-edge AI capabilities
- Opportunity to build unique competitive advantages
- Higher risk of investing in technologies that don't scale
- Potential to attract top AI talent who want to work with latest tools

*When This Position Makes Sense:*

- Innovation is core to your competitive strategy
- You have sufficient resources to absorb failures
- Your industry rewards first-mover advantages
- You have technical expertise to evaluate nascent technologies

**Early Adopters (13.5%): The Strategic Visionaries**

*Strategic Characteristics:*

- Adopt proven concepts before widespread implementation
- Balance innovation with practical business value
- Often become reference customers for technology vendors
- Influence industry adoption patterns

*AI Strategy Implications:*

- Access to mature pilot programs and initial commercial offerings
- Opportunity to shape AI solutions for your industry
- Moderate risk with higher probability of success

- Require references and case studies before adoption
- Focus on practical implementation over innovation
- Seek to minimize risk while maintaining competitiveness

*AI Strategy Implications:*

- Access to proven AI solutions with demonstrated value
- Lower implementation risk with established best practices
- Potential to lose competitive advantage to early movers
- More vendor options and competitive pricing

*When This Position Makes Sense:*

- Your competitive advantage comes from execution, not innovation
- Risk tolerance is low due to regulatory or operational constraints
- Resources are limited and must be deployed efficiently
- Your industry has not shown clear AI competitive advantages

**Late Majority (34%): The Cautious Followers**

*Strategic Characteristics:*

- Driven by competitive pressure rather than opportunity
- Focus on cost reduction over capability enhancement
- Prefer mature, stable solutions

*AI Strategy Implications:*

- Access to commoditized AI solutions
- Minimal competitive advantage from AI adoption
- Risk of being disrupted by AI-native competitors
- Focus on efficiency rather than innovation

*When This Position Makes Sense:*

- Your industry has low technology adoption rates
- Regulatory constraints prevent early adoption
- Your competitive advantage is based on non-technology factors
- Resources must be focused on immediate operational needs

**Laggards (16%): The Resistant Traditionalists**

*Strategic Characteristics:*

- Adopt only when forced by market or regulatory pressure
- Focus on traditional methods and proven approaches
- Skeptical of new technology benefits
- Often constrained by legacy systems or culture

*AI Strategy Implications:*

- Risk of competitive obsolescence
- Potential for significant disruption
- Limited access to AI talent and expertise
- May face customer/partner pressure to modernize

*When This Position Makes Sense:*

- Your industry is stable with minimal technology disruption
- Customers prefer traditional approaches
- Regulatory environment prevents or discourages AI adoption
- Resources are extremely constrained
