    Create a p5.js MicroSim that generates a line chart.
    Across the bottom x axis draw an axis label "Time".
    In the center of the Time axis draw a vertical brown line with the label "Now".

    Across the left vertical axis draw an axis with the label "Rate of Improvement".

    Draw four lines on the chart:

    1. Growth and Decline: initial rapid growth but peaking now and will be declining in the future 
    2. Growth and Flattening: initial rapid growth but flatting out 
    3. Linear Growth: initial rapid growth but slow linear growth 
    4. Exponential Growth: initial rapid growth and continued exponential growth

    Add a checkbox control to display each option.
