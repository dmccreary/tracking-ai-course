## How to Use This Infographic

I've created a comprehensive interactive infographic for the GenAI Center of Excellence idea funnel process. Here's what the visualization includes:

## Key Features:

**Central Funnel Visualization**

- 7 color-coded stages from "AI Training" to "Go Live" 
- Funnel shape narrows to show the filtering effect
- Numbered stages for easy reference
- Interactive hover functionality with detailed descriptions

**Side Panels**

- **Left**: "New GenAI Idea Form" showing form elements and submit button
- **Right**: "Summary Dashboard" with real KPIs and metrics visualization

**Interactive Elements**
- Hover over any funnel stage to see detailed explanations
- Info boxes that follow the mouse and stay within bounds
- Visual feedback with highlighted borders on hover
- Flow arrows connecting the form → funnel → dashboard

**The Seven Funnel Stages:**

1. **Training Program** - 1-hour AI literacy training
2. **Idea Submission** - Universal web form for all employees  
3. **Expert Review** - Technical feasibility and business assessment
4. **Scoring & Categorization** - Systematic evaluation framework
5. **Monthly Selection** - Funding decisions by expert panel
6. **Development** - Building solutions with dedicated teams
7. **Deployment** - Going live with monitoring and ROI measurement

The infographic uses a professional color scheme and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. Users can explore each stage of the process by hovering to understand the complete workflow from initial idea submission through successful deployment.

This visualization effectively communicates the systematic, structured approach of the GenAI CoE while providing an engaging way for stakeholders to understand how ideas flow through the organization's innovation pipeline.

## Discussion Questions for Team Review

### Understanding the Process

1. **Process Flow**: Walk through the seven stages of the GenAI CoE funnel in your own words. What is the primary purpose of each stage?

2. **Filtering Effect**: Why does the funnel narrow from top to bottom? What are the benefits and potential drawbacks of this filtering approach?

3. **Timeline Expectations**: Based on the process described, how long should someone expect from idea submission to potential deployment? What factors might accelerate or delay this timeline?

### Personal and Team Application

4. **Opportunity Identification**: What specific challenges or repetitive tasks in your daily work could potentially benefit from AI assistance? How would you begin to formulate these as concrete ideas?

5. **Idea Quality**: Looking at the submission form elements, what additional information would you need to gather before submitting a well-formed idea? Who in your network could help you develop these details?

6. **Success Metrics**: For a potential AI solution in your area, how would you measure success? What baseline data would you need to collect to demonstrate improvement?

### Strategic Thinking

7. **Resource Allocation**: Given that only 2-5 ideas are selected for development each month, what criteria should the expert panel prioritize? How would you balance quick wins vs. transformational projects?

8. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: How might teams with similar challenges work together through this process? What are the benefits and challenges of collaborative idea development?

9. **Risk Management**: What types of risks should be considered when evaluating AI ideas? How does the systematic review process help mitigate these risks?

### Organizational Impact

10. **Cultural Change**: How does this structured approach to AI innovation differ from how new ideas are typically handled in our organization? What cultural shifts might be needed for success?

11. **Competitive Advantage**: How does having a systematic AI innovation process help our organization compared to ad-hoc AI initiatives? What external factors should we consider?

12. **Continuous Improvement**: Based on the dashboard metrics shown, what trends would indicate that the GenAI CoE is successful? What would suggest the need for process improvements?

### Implementation Readiness

13. **Personal Preparation**: What steps will you take to prepare yourself to contribute effectively to this process? What additional training or information do you need?

14. **Team Engagement**: How will you share this information with your immediate team? What specific opportunities might exist for your department?

15. **Feedback and Iteration**: If you submitted an idea that wasn't selected for development, what would you do next? How could the feedback help improve future submissions?

### Future Considerations

16. **Scaling Success**: As more AI solutions are deployed successfully, how should the organization scale this process? What new challenges might emerge?

17. **Technology Evolution**: How should this process adapt as AI technology continues to evolve rapidly? What mechanisms exist for incorporating new capabilities?

18. **Measurement and ROI**: Beyond the dashboard metrics shown, what other measures of success should the organization track? How do we balance quantitative and qualitative benefits?

## Assessment and Follow-up

Teams should reconvene after initial exploration to discuss these questions and develop action plans for engagement with the GenAI CoE process. Consider scheduling follow-up sessions to review actual submissions and share early experiences with the process.
