# Tracking AI

This is a 30-minute presentation used to help organization understand
how tracking AI is part of their AI strategy and their overall organizational
strategy.

## Slide 1: Introduction

### Does your organization have a formal AI strategy?
### How do you predict the growth rate of AI?

## Slide 2: Growth Rates

### There are four possible growth rates of AI:

1. Growth and Decline - AI is just a passing fad
2. Steady State - no change from current capabilities
3. Linear Growth - slow rise
4. Exponential Growth - like Moore's Law - doubling every X months

What does the evidence show about how AI is growing in capabilities?

## Slide 4: METR: Measuring Task Complexity

### Measuring AI Capabilities With Task Complexity

How do we measure the overall capability of an AI system?

One way is to estimate how long a human takes to complete a task.
We can assume that longer tasks are more complex and require more intelligence.
We can then measure what the probability of an AI completing a task correctly.
**Example:** Given a task to count the words in a paragraph.  How long would this task take an average human?

## Slide 4: METR

The METR.org studies show that AI has been doubling
